## Format

Accelerate your programming skills by mastering the Object Oriented Programming while creating a Spring Boot REST API application for a Dental Clinic.Ô∏èÔ∏è

<v-clicks>

- üìò **Master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Explore the fundamental elements of OOP in Kotlin.

- üíª **Apply OOP Principles with Spring Boot** - Solidify your grasp of OOP by integrating its concepts into a 'Dentist Clinic' Spring Boot application.

- üèÅ **Craft a REST API** - Illuminate and test your application through a RESTful interface, leveraging Swagger and unit tests.

- üéí **Engaging Take-Home Assignments** - Undertake practical coding challenges to enhance your application's range and depth.

# Class relationships

### "Has-a" Relationships (Composition)
Example: A `Patient` class **has a** `DentalRecord`.

```plantuml
@startuml

class Patient {
  -DentalRecord record
}
class DentalRecord {
}
Patient --> DentalRecord : has-a

@enduml
```

---

### "Has-a" Relationships (Composition) types

<v-clicks>

- One-to-one: One instance relates to exactly one other instance.

- One-to-many: One instance relates to multiple other instances.

- Many-to-many: Multiple instances relate to multiple other instances.

- Bidirectional: Mutual association.

</v-clicks>

### "Is-a" Relationships (Inheritance)
Inheritance illustrates the "Is-a" relationship. In our Dental Clinic:
- A `Dentist` **is a** `DentalPractitioner`.
- A `Hygienist` **is a** `DentalPractitioner`.


```plantuml
@startuml
interface DentalPractitioner {
  +performTreatment(patient: Patient, treatment: Treatment): String
}

class Dentist {
}

class Hygienist {
}

Dentist -up-|> DentalPractitioner : implements
Hygienist -up-|> DentalPractitioner : implements
@enduml
```

class Appointment 

class Dentist 

class Patient 

class DentalRecord 

class Treatment 

Appointment o-- Patient : Has
Appointment o-- Dentist : Has
Appointment o-- Treatment : Involves
Dentist -- Patient : Performs treatment on
Patient o-- DentalRecord : Has
DentalRecord o-- Treatment : Records

@enduml

```

```plantuml {scale: 1}
@startuml

class Clinic 
class Appointment 
class Dentist 
class Patient
class Treatment

Clinic "1" *-- "*" Appointment : has >
Clinic "1" *-- "*" Dentist : has >
Clinic "1" *-- "*" Patient : has >
Clinic "1" *-- "*" Treatment : has >
